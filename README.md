# personal_website_v2
This is my portfolio website and a testing grounds/hosting area for spontaneous project ideas (version 2!)

This is a really good opportunity to improve my skills in React, CSS, and Gatsby, and I hope in the future to experiment with much more complex CSS as well as some more complex react functionality.
